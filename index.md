## Chapters
### Audio reactive visuals with TouchDesigner and Stable Diffusion web UI
First, I worked with StableDiffusion web UI and TouchDesigner. I followed an extensive tutorial by [elekktronaut]() which introduced the workflow for creating visuals in TouchDesigner and then feeding it as img2img input to StableDiffusion web UI along with prompts to create audio reactive visuals.
The documentation of this part consists of various parts:
- [Stable Diffusion web UI installation](./stable-diffusion/stable-diffusion-install.md)
- [Floral diffusion tutorial documentation](./stable-diffusion/floral-diffusion/floraldiffusion.md)
- [Floral diffusion results](./stable-diffusion/floral-diffusion/index.md)

### Timelapse video of drawing with TouchDesigner and Stable Diffusion web UI
Second, I applied this workflow to create a timelapse video of a drawing of mine to use the timelapse of the drawing as input and extending it with Stable Diffusion web UI.

### Music video with TouchDesigner and StreamDiffusion
Third, I installed StreamDiffusion and created a music video for "Love, Peace and Happiness" with TouchDesigner in Combination with StreamDiffusion.
