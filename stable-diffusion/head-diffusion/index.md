For this experiment, I wanted to create a timelapse animation which is based on a timelapse of a drawing of mine. Therefore I recorder myself while drawing a sketch. I sped the recording up and created a workflow in TouchDesigner to create the animation.

I experimented with various prompts that focussed on masks, ornaments and patterns.

TODO: add prompts, add screenshots, add gifs
